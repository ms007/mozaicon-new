# Add Shape: $ARGUMENTS

Add a new shape type called `$ARGUMENTS` to the SVG Icon Creator.

## Before starting

Read these files in order:

1. @docs/shapes.md — the full walkthrough (required)
2. @src/types/shapes.ts — the current shape union
3. @src/features/canvas/renderers/ShapeRenderer.tsx — the renderer dispatch
4. @docs/architecture.md — section "State Shape" (if you need context on the schema)

## Task

Implement the new shape type following every step in `docs/shapes.md`:

1. Zod schema in `src/types/shapes.ts` (extend the discriminated union)
2. Renderer component in `src/features/canvas/renderers/`
3. Bounding box handler in `src/lib/svg/bbox.ts`
4. Translate handler in `src/lib/svg/transform.ts`
5. Hit test in `src/lib/svg/hitTest.ts`
6. Export serializer in `src/features/export/serializers/`
7. Properties editor in `src/features/properties/editors/`
8. Drawing tool in `src/features/toolbar/tools/` (only if the shape is user-drawable — ask me if unsure)
9. Tests for: schema validation, bbox correctness, translate invariants, export round-trip

## Rules

- **Do not suppress TypeScript errors.** After step 1, TS will flag every missing case via `assertNever`. Those errors are your checklist — work through them one by one.
- **Do not skip tests.** Each pure-function addition (`lib/`) needs a unit test.
- **Run `npm run check` after step 5 and again at the end.** Stop and report if it fails.
- **Follow existing patterns.** Look at how `circle` or `rect` is implemented for reference.

## Report back

When done, summarize:

- Which files you created or modified
- How `npm run check` finished (pass/fail)
- Any decisions you made that aren't obvious from the code (e.g., how you handled edge cases)
- Whether a drawing tool was added, or whether it still needs one
